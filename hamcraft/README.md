# Rust Programming Language Example Code

This folder contains a bunch of code that I've written while learning how to program in Rust. The code is not organized into a single purpose, but rather as an archive.


    📦hello_world - The main folder of the rust code
    ┃
    ┣━━ 📂src - Rust source files
    ┃   ┃
    ┃   ┗━━ 📜main.rs - The file that should get called first
    ┃
    ┣━━ 📦tests - Integration tests
    ┃
    ┣━━ 📜.gitignore - Tracks files that shouldn't be included in the Git repo
    ┃
